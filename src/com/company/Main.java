    Here's what I posted on 2016-7-5:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        I'm trying to solve the problem, and have two questions. First, should we account for the thickness
    of the walls when calculating the number of encounters per second? I found several references to the
    nuclear radius relationship, but so far I can't tell if the calculated radius is based on the midpoints
    of the nucleons (the walls) or the exterior. The measurements seem to be based on scattering things off
    the surface, which in the macro-scale realm would find the exterior radius. Obviously a squishy, fuzzy,
    undulating nucleus is not a macro-scale sphere, but I can't figure out if that makes enough of a
    difference to justify disregarding the radius of the nucleons when talking about the radius of the
    nucleus. One source described how the protons are likely to be pushed to the outside of the nucleus,
    suggesting that the wall thickness will be even greater than the diameter of a nucleon, but I'm guessing
    that we don't need to account for that part. The diagram at 1:49 in the video suggests that we don't need
    to worry about the thickness (for the first part of the challenge), and just plug in the number from the
    nuclear radius relationship equation, but I'd like confirmation.

        Second, is it truly OK to treat the alpha particle as bouncing perfectly back & forth, in effect
    travelling the entire diameter of the interior on each cycle? On the macro scale, a marble bouncing around
    inside a balloon would almost never travel through the exact center. In some cases it might even get into
    a trajectory that keeps it rolling in continuous contact with the walls. Again, the diagram at 1:49 in the
    video suggests that we can use a very simple back & forth model, but I'd like confirmation that it's OK. I
    already know that quantum effects will make the behavior very different from a marble inside a balloon,
    but I don't know nearly enough to estimate those differences. Thanks in advance.ï»¿

    Update: I posted some additional comments, largely in response to a guy named Gareth Dean. He addressed
    several of my questions by answering similar questions
