# PoloniumBouncer
PBS Space Time challenge, June 2016 : calculate alpha-particle bounces inside a Polonium 212 nucleus

This is an exercise question to help me learn Java, not production code. The problem is presented in this video from PBS Space Time:

All of the core requirements of this program are defined by that video, so it's the final authority. Anything beyond that is just me playing around with Java as I try to learn it better. I'll probably try a bunch of stupid things, so again, this is not production code to copy and re-use. I'm very open to feedback.
